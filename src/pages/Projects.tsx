      title: "RAG-Based Recipe Generator",
      description: `
        A full-stack recipe suggestion web app powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Users input ingredients they have at home, and the system semantically searches a 50K+ recipe dataset to return relevant, plausible recipes, even when there's no exact ingredient match. Built with OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone for vector search, and LangChain for context injection and prompt orchestration. The React + TypeScript frontend is deployed via AWS S3 + CloudFront, while the backend runs serverlessly on AWS Lambda with API Gateway and DynamoDB. Async job handling allows scalable recipe generation, with polling support and status tracking.
